# Leo`s Raylib-Quickstart fork

A simple template for setting up a project with raylib code using **C++** , **VisualStudio2022** and **Windows**.

# This fork

This fork simplifies [Raylib-Quickstart](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart) by removing features and making it strict to:
 - Visual Studio 2022
 - C++
 - Windows (Dev environment)

# Using this template you can start a new C++ project in just two clicks.

* Run `build-VisualStudio2022.bat`
* Run the `.sln` file that was generated
* you are good to go ! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

# Using this template

First, change the icon `./resources/icon.png` and the player `./resources/wabbit_alpha.png.\
Duplicate, rename, and change the class `./src/MyClass` .h .cpp\
Edit the Main function at ./src/main.cpp to use your class.

# Ship your game

After opening Visual Studio and running the code as release, you will find the EXE at `/bin`.\
To share your game, copy that EXE and the `./resources` folder to the same place.\
It should look like this:

FolderWithYourGame\
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/                   # Assets folder (contains images, sounds, etc.)\
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icon.png\
â””â”€â”€ YourGame.exe

## Dangerous files from the internet

I would never open an EXE that a stranger sent me from the internet, so why would you?! This project is created using `premake5.exe`.\
It came from https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart , but you can also download it here: https://premake.github.io/download/
